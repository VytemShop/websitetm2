Massive Update:
Log 1.0.0 - Fixed Background, Added Edit And Delete Button, UI Cleanup, Added Notifications.

(Note: This isn't considered a massive update, to me it is though because of how far it has gone. There is more to come, don't worry.)

Log 1.0.1 - Cannot chat without entering a username -> Should have been fixed awhile ago.
Future Update - Add profile pictures?, etc.


Log 1.0.2 - Massive UI Update -> Much cleaner looking, some visual effects.
(Note: Visual effects should probably be toggable)

Log 1.0.3 - Fantastic Update -> Visual effects now toggable, Added profile pictures, fixed background.

(Plans for next update: Add some stickers, gifs, etc. & Fixing major serversided vulnerabilities, Yes there is a lot of them)
